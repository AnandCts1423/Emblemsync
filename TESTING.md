## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **❌ Backend Won't Start**
```bash
# Check virtual environment
cd backend
dir venv
# If missing, run:
setup.bat
```

### **❌ Frontend Won't Start**
```bash
# Check node modules
cd frontend
dir node_modules
# If missing, run:
npm install
```

### **❌ "ModuleNotFoundError: flask_socketio"**
```bash
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **❌ Connection Issues**
- Ensure backend is running on port 5000
- Ensure frontend is running on port 3000
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Verify CORS settings in backend

### **❌ Real-time Features Not Working**
- Check browser developer tools → Network → WS tab
- Verify WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:5000`
- Ensure Flask-SocketIO is properly installed

## 📊 **ARCHITECTURE VERIFICATION**

### **✅ Proper MVP Separation:**

1. **Backend (Model + Logic):**
   - All database operations
   - File processing logic
   - Business rule validation
   - Real-time broadcasting
   - API endpoint handling

2. **Frontend (View + UI Only):**
   - Component rendering
   - User interface interactions
   - API call orchestration
   - State management (UI only)
   - No business logic

3. **Communication (Presenter):**
   - Clean API boundaries
   - Real-time WebSocket events
   - Error handling
   - Data serialization
